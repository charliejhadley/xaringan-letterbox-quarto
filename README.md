# {xaringan} letterbox effect in quarto

[`{xaringan}`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) is a much loved format for interactive presentations with RMarkdown. It has a distinctive style that includes a "letterbox" effect on slides, which comes from the remark.js framework used to build the slides.

This repository aims only to demonstrate how it's not possible to replicate this effect usefully in quarto.

```{bash}
quarto install extension charliejhadley/xaringan-quarto
```
